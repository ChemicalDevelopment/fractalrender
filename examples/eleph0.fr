# comments start with '#'
# first real line should have these 3 values (width, height, and fps):
w=640 h=480 f=24

# other lines should have keyframes with '<time>: <vals...>'
# for example, 'zre' is the real component of 'z', 'zim' is the imaginary component of 'z'
0.0: zre=0.2821 zim=0.01 zoominitial=0.2 zoomrate=1.8 maxiter=100

# set the 'done' flag to 1 to finish
4.0: done=1.0
